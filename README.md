Story builder group game via SMS

* Person texts game number
* New session, give them a game code
* Alert VIP when new people join. vip can ask for all numbers, gets a list to start new group message. along with sample message text (welcome, etc)
* Users text game number with code to join. Game asks them for a name
* When ready, VIP says start.
* New group message with everyone, listing players and instructions.
* Each player starts their story (theme?)
* Limit to response? time,length?
* Once every player has responded to every other story-starter, finish
* Send group text with everyone's name or a bunch of links? (must be formatted). Or a webpage with all the links
* You can listen and vote from text. (twilio doesn't accept messages from group text?
* After voting, send group text message with link to save the recording to google drive. VIP gets the data to paste into the group message.

Doesn't look like twilio does group sms: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26690403/twilio-sms-facilitating-a-group-sms

any way to start a new group text? send all the numbers to VIP and have them start it? shortcut to send to all those numbers? start from email? 

in a group setting maybe everyone gets a different persons story to read.
